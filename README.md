# MNIST-Classification
Pattern Recognition Course

We implement three different types of classification methods on the MNIST dataset
which consists of tens of thousands of hand-drawn images of digits from 0-9.
The three methods we cover are Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree classifiers. These methods delivered reasonable
results in terms of their accuracy in classifying between the 10 digits, but these
classification methods are outclassed by the more modern neural networks.
